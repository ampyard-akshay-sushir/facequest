          FaceQuest’s face recognition service can be used to secure ATM transactions. When a user tries to access the ATM machine by inserting the debit card, the camera on the kiosk will capture the image of the user & search it through the
          database of the account holder and match it with the photograph on his account. The user will still login with his PIN, but in case of the photograph not matching the profile an otp will be sent to the account holder via sms/email so that
          they can recognise or report the transaction. If an account holder wants to authorise multiple users to use his debit card, he can request it to the bank at anytime & update them with the photographs of the additional users.

          FaceQuest can helps banks or life insurance companies, in order to prevent fraudulent claims. While buying a life insurance policy, the insured person would need to submit a photograph of the nominee(s) and ever year an updated photograph
          of the nominee(s) can be submitted by the insured person to the bank or life insurance company. In case of the death of the insured person & the nominee(s) requesting claim of amount for the life insurance policy, the insurance navigator
          click a photograph of the nominee(s) & run it through the FaceQuest solution in order to match the photograph with the photograph submitted by the insured person earlier. In case there is not a significant match of the 2 photographs, the
          investigator can take an action to scrutinise the investigation.

          FaceQuest’s facial recognition service can help airlines streamline the check-in & boarding process for their passengers. While booking the flight online, the passenger can upload his image or can upload a photo id proof. The passenger can
          then directly go to the airline counter to check-in the baggage, the passenger need not print any boarding pass or baggage tag. When a passenger goes to the airline counter, the camera there will click the photograph & run it through the
          database & streamline the baggage drop process. This will over all reduce the wait time for all the passengers. Also when boarding the flight through the gate, another camera can be placed which will eliminate the usage of scanning the
          boarding pass & save time for the passengers as well as the airline.

          FaceQuest’s face recognition service can be used by competitive testing agencies in order to prevent fraudulent impersonations of test takers. There are various number of cases, where some person impersonates the test taker in order to help
          him qualify for the test. Testing agencies can click photograph of every test taker appearing for the test, it will run through the test taker database & find for matches, incase it doesn’t find any match, it will store as a new reference
          face on the database on that uuid of that test taker.

          <ul>
            <li>To prevent fraud: In case FaceQuest finds a match with a previous test taker, it will be notified to the examination convener or any other concerned person, they can then match the uuid of the new test taker with the old test taker,
              in
              case of any discrepancy, the convener can make a decision on whether to allow or disallow the test taker to appear for the test</li>

          Hyperlocal delivery & ride service hailing aggregators mostly rely on delivery or driver partners in order to provide service to the end user. In order to ensure the safety of the end user, the aggregators can ask the partner to click a
          live photograph from their partner app & submit it to the company database. FaceQuest will help the companies to match the submitted photograph with the photograph stored in the database. It will help the aggregators to identify if some
          other person is using the partner’s app to provide the service, the aggregator companies can then make a decision to temporarily block the profile of the partner.
